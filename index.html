		<p>
			I’ve recently relocated to San Francisco and I’m excited to look for a new opportunity to grow my career in the food and healthcare industry!

			I studied dietetics in Australia. For the past 5 years, I’ve worked as a dietitian at Queen Mary Hospital, one of the two teaching hospitals in Hong Kong. As someone who enjoys traveling to learn about different cultures through locals, it has been very rewarding to work in multidisciplinary teams of health professionals to provide holistic care to a diverse clientele.
